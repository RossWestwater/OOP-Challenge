# <OOP-Challenge>

## Description

This is a simple employee organizational generator that takes inputs from the inquirer npm in Node.js and exports the data into a formatted HTML file. It could be used to log a Manager and his/her team at a given moment (ie. time of generation). Using test driven development prior to writing functional code through the Jest npm in node was rewarding. Nothing like seeing that "pass" when all the syntaxes and such were sorted out. Learning how to format and pass data through to the various pages was a particular challenge and merging concepts from the last couple modules and the readme generator was challenging, but rewarding. Going back through the code to consolidate some duplicates was also hard for me to figure out. I needed tutor help for it, but it mostly makes sense.

## Installation

In order to use this README-Generator, the user must:

Clone the repo containing the app
Install Node.js on their computer via the LTS link (https://nodejs.org/en/)
Run the 'npm i' command in their terminal from the correct root folder location of the cloned repo to sync the depndencies (ie. Inquirer and Jest in this instance)
run the app using the 'node index' command from the same root folder as the cloned repo
Follow the prompts to get the HTML file with generated Manager and any accompanying Engineers and Interns.

## Usage

## Tests

These are located in the repo and can be completed by running the 'npm run test' in the terminal from the root folder after installing the npm's, as referenced in the above installation section.
